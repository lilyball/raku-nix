Raku-Nix
========

This repository houses [Nix] support for [Raku].

[Nix]: https://nixos.org/nix/
[Raku]: https://raku.org

Ecosystem
---------

In the [ecosystem](ecosystem) directory you can find
Nix expressions for existing Raku packages.
These are exported from [default.nix](default.nix) as well.

These are generated by tools/generate-nix.pl,
using information collected by [CRAI].

[CRAI]: https://crai.foldr.nl

**Note:** CRAI appears to be gone, so autocreation isn't happening anymore.

Usage
-----

Currently these instructions assume you are experienced with Nix.
More handholding may follow later (also: PRs welcome).

Obtain raku-nix using fetchTarball as usual, and import it:

```nix
let
    pkgs = /* … */;
    raku-nix = import /* … */ {inherit pkgs;};
in
    /* … */
```

Now you can define your project with the _raku-nix.rakuPackage_ function.
For an example, see [example/default.nix](example/default.nix).
